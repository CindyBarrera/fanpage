        <h3>First we'll start with information on the show as a whole and the creators</h3>
        
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>American Horror Story(also known as AHS) is an American anthology horror television series that was created and produced by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk. The show was released on October 11, 2011 and is still going on today. American horror story is known for falling into different categories: horror, anthology, supernatural, science-fiction, drama, and erotic thriller. <b>(What is anthology? Good question! Anthology is a collection of poems or other pieces of writing)</b> AHS can be watched on the channel FX every  Wednesday at 10PM ET/PT time.There are currently a total of 5 seasons. The 6th season will premier on September 14, 2016. American Horror Story releases a couple of creepy trailers for each season. Each AHS season has the same opening credits song. I have to be honest, I mute the tv before the opening credits song starts and I also can't seem to bring myself to watch AHS late at night. It gives me the creeps all day. I'm so nice that I'll even link the song below</p>

        <h3>American Horror Story and its seasons</h3>
        
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>So there are a total of 6 seasons, like I mentioned earlier. Each season has its own story, takes place in different years and locations. With each story also come different cast members. However, some actors do play a different character in multiple seasons. There are also characters from past seasons that make an appearance in other seasons. Everyone part of the AHS club knows that for all seasons there are a few actors that will <b>always</b> be in the season. Our main cast members since the series started have been Sarah Paulson, Lily Rabe, and Evan Peters. We've also had many great actors throughout the series, but we'll talk about the characters in the next page of this webstire hehe</p>
