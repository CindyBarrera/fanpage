        <h3>Murder House</h3>
        
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <p>The first season of American Horror Story was called Murder House. This season aired from October 5, 2011 to December 21, 2011. The first season is about the Harmons, a family of 3.  The mother is Vivien. The father is Ben, and the daughter is Violet. In the season, the family moves into a mansion where multiple deaths have happened throughout the years. All of those ghosts are stuck on the property and live there. In the season, Tate meets Violet and they become close. Later on, Vivien becomes pregnant with twins from different fathers, one of them being Tate. Constance finds out that Tate's child is the Antichrist and has a plan to take the baby.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <p>When the ghosts find out that Vivien is pregant, they gather up to make her seem crazy and be able to take her child in the end. Later on, Violet finds out that one of the baby's is Tate's and she tells him to "Go away Tate!". Violet is left feeling suicidal and sad, so she tries to commit suicide. A month later she realizes that she actually did die and is now stuck in the house. When Vivien gives birth, Ben's child dies and so does she, leaving only Tate's. Vivien and Violet let Ben know that he needs to leave the house, but before he can, his ex girlfriend kills him and makes it look like a suicide. Constance then takes the child and tells police that Violet must of ran off with the baby.</p>

            <p>A lot more things happened throughout the season, but I couldn't find pictures of them. Some things were also too gory so... Anyway, so in the end the Harmon family ends up dead and their Antichrist child is taken by Constance. Tate and Violet get to be together forever just how he wanted.</p>

            <p>Now onto my favorite part of this website. The next page will be very short and a lot of "fangirling" will happen. I'll try to act as normal of a human being as I can, but come on. It's going to be <b>Tate Langdon</b> I talk about. Every girl that has seen Murder House has definitely loved Tate, and Evan Peters as a whole. So lets go on to getting started!</p>
