            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p> I'm way more excited than I should be. So Tate Langdon is a character in the first season of American Horror Story. He took a big part in the season actually. As most of us should know, he was the reason Vivien had an Antichrist child and why she died. He was also "a thing" with Violet. She's honestly my second favorite character. <b>Anyway back to Tate,</b> in the show he was a ghost that was trapped in the house where Violet lived. They became close and loved each other. In the end Violet finds out about what Tate did to her mother and she uses everybody's favorite line, "Go away Tate!". That is forever our favorite line from Violet.</p>

        <h2>About Evan Peters</h2>
        
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <p>
                Tate's character is played by Evan Peters. Evan was born on Janury 20, 1987. He was born in St. Louis, Missaouri. He is currently 20, but honestly he looks a lot younger than that. I mean, have you seen him? Moving on, he use to be engaged to Emma Roberts and then he wasn't, but now we're not exactly sure again because they seem to be on and off. Apparently she isn't a good person to him. We all wish he was dating Violet, but no sadly. Anyway, from 2004 to 2010, Evan did multiple national commercials <b>(honesyly I didn't know this until right now, ha).</b>

            <p>
                Some of the commercials he did were on Disney Channel and The CW. Evan has been in the main cast of American Horror Story since it first started in 2011. He was also Quicksilver in <i>X-Men: Days of Future Past</i><b>(he reminded me of Tate in the movie. I cried inside while watching the movie because the first season was just that good, ugh)</b>

                <b>Let me just say that Evan Peters has amazing hair, but he isn't exactly photogenic ha</b>. Now I'll just post a few more pictures of him and we're done!
